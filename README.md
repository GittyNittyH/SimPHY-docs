Welcome to our Wiki, a place for comprehensive documentation on all the SimPHY tools and features. This wiki is community driven, and can be edited by anyone. If you find information out of date or want to add some more in-depth explanations, you are very welcome to do the necessary changes.

## Circuit Module
You can add wires, resistors, AC DC batteries, Switches, different instruments to measure current electricity variables like Ammeter, Voltmeter, Potentiometer, Bulbs, Capacitor, Inductors, Diodes, Transformers, Logic Gates and introduce variability in their values using sliders to make them interactive, to simulate all kinds of Circuit Diagrams in SimPHY's Circuit Module.

## Optics Module
You can add ideal Plane, Concave and Convex mirrors and lens and real devices, Prism, ray, beam etc and edit their properties, add slider to interact with them, to simulate Optical problems, get real and virtual images, make microscope and telescope in Optics Module.
